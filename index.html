            <h3>About Me</h3>
            </header>
          <p>After graduating college, I moved to Boston and started working as an accountant. I worked in a big-four firm and most recently at a tech company, where I am an in-house tax manager. While at my current company, I have been part of various research & development studies which re-piqued my interest in web development (I first found it in an undergraduate class). I currently work on a team of 7 people and am looking forward to working together with everyone I meet during my program.</p>
          <p>Even though I am currently a tax manager & on my way to become a web developer, I have interests outside of both of these. Some of which include:</p>
